### Ayo, what's good
I'm Felkon
- 👨‍💼 Professionally, I'm a Front-End dev (SalesForce (LWC) / AWS)
- 👨‍💻 Recreationally, I'm a Full-Stack dev (React, C#, C++, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL)

I don't really use GitHub outside of some small projects, but who knows what happens in the future

### Where you can find me:
* [On Twitter](https://twitter.com/FelkonEx)
* On Discord: Felkon#9447
* [On Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKIEMpmi0mxRDIognD3Ejng)
* [On Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/felkonEx)

If there's issues with my code, submit an issue on the repo instead of messaging me on any of the above.

If you like what i do, you can buy me a coffee here: https://ko-fi.com/felkon, but there's no real need to since i work a cringe 9-5
